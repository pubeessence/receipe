    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment
            paper or lightly grease them.</li>
        <li>Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter,
            granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add Eggs and Vanilla: Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully
            incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and
            salt.</li>
        <li>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture,
            mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Fold in Chocolate Chips: Gently fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed
            throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Form Cookie Dough: Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving space between each cookie for spreading.</li>
        <li>Bake: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown around the edges.</li>
        <li>Cool and Enjoy: Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Serve: Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or as a treat any time of the day!
        </li>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>

    <ul type="1">
        <li>For chewier cookies, slightly underbake them and let them rest on the baking sheet for a
            few extra minutes after removing them from the oven.</li>
        <li>You can add chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans for extra texture if desired.</li>
        <li>Store cookies in an airtight container to maintain freshness.</li>
